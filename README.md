# Autonomous-Landing-of-Model-Rockets
In this this project we attempt to land a model rocket propulsively. It is a work in progress and we'll keep this repo updated. 

MATLAB and Simulink:
Rocket Parameters: Data_for_simulation.m

PID Controller: 
PID3dof.slx 

Six_DoF_PID.slx

LQR:
Three_DoF_LQR.slx

Six_DoF_LQR.slx

State Space Model:
ss_3DoF_LQR.m

ss_6DoF_LQR.m
